# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming, introduced by Barbara Liskov. It states that:

"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program."

In simpler terms, if you have a class Parent, and a class Child that inherits from Parent, you should be able to use an instance of Child wherever Parent is expected, without introducing errors or unexpected behavior.
