# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is a key concept in object-oriented programming, stating that software entities (such as classes, modules, and functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code, thus reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
