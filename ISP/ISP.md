# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Instead of creating large, "fat" interfaces, it's better to split them into smaller, more specific ones that reflect the needs of different clients.
